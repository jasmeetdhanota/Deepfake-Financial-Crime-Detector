🚀 AI Payment Fraud Risk Lab

AI-driven FinCrime risk analytics prototype designed to detect deepfake-enabled payment fraud and social-engineering attacks in enterprise banking environments.

Inspired by real-world fraud scenarios such as CEO impersonation, business email compromise (BEC), and AI voice/deepfake payment instructions.

🔍 Problem Statement

Financial institutions face rising fraud risk from:

Deepfake voice payment approvals

CEO / executive impersonation

Urgent wire transfer scams
